# Software Engineer interview exercise (FAANG)

####_Given a list of integers and considering them as the heights of a graph of bars, calculate how much 'water' can fit in._

To understand the question, let's use an image, it will be clearer

Given the input `[6, 0, 4, 1, 3]`, the result should be `6` units of water 

![input 6 0 4 1 3](_images/input.JPG "Graph representing the input [6 0 4 1 3]")

### Some test cases:

![same height fist and last](_images/1.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/2.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/3.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/4.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/5.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/6.JPG "same height fist and last")

![same height fist and last](_images/7.JPG "same height fist and last")
